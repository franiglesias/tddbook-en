# Basic TDD concepts #

In this first part we'll introduce the basic concepts to understand what is Test Driven Development and how it's different from other disciplines and methodologies that use tests. We'll also talk about how can you learn TDD, be it individually or in a team of practice community.

The first chapter has a general introduction to the process of Test Driven Development.

The chapter about basic concepts is a glossary that we'll make use of throughout the book.

Finally, the chapter about coding-dojo and kata proposed some simple ideas to start practicing with a team or by oneself.
