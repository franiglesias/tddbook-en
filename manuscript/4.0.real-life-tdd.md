# TDD in real life #

In this part, we'll deal with how it's possible to incorporate TDD in all of the development processes in real projects.

We'll work in a project to create the backend of a simple to-do list application. The same that we've used for the *outside-in* example. But this time we'll have a slightly different starting point, with the project organization based on user stories.

The second chapter of this part will show us how to work when we have to fix a bug, from the way of reproducing it, to the steps that we'll have to follow in order to solve it.

The third chapter is about the implementation of new user stories in the system.
