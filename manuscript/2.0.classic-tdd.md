# Classic TDD #

In this part we present a series of code exercises with which we'll explore in depth how Test Driven Development is done.

We'll use the discipline's classic style or approach. TDD is a software development methodology *re-discovered* by Kent Beck, based on the way that the first computer programs used to be built. Then, calculations were first carried out by hand, so as to have the reference of the expected the result that would have to be reproduced in the computer. In TDD, we write a very simple program that tests that the result of other program matches the expected one. The key here is that this program hasn't been written yet. It's that simple.

The methodology was presented by Beck in his book *TDD by example*, in which, among other things, teaches how to build a testing *framework* using TDD. Subsequently, various authors have contributed to the refinement and systematization of the model.
