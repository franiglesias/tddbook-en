# Evolution of the behavior through tests

The TDD methodology is based in work cycles with which we define a desired behavior in the form of a test, we make changes in the production code to implement it, and we refactor the solution once we know that it works.

While we have specific tooling to detect situations in need of refactoring, and even well-define methods to carry it out, we don't have specific resources that guide the necessary code transformations in a similar manner. That is, is there any process that help us decide what kind of change to apply to the code in otder to implement a behavior?

[The Transformation Priority Premise](http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2013/05/27/TheTransformationPriorityPremise.html)[^fn32] is an article that suggests a useful *framework* in this sense. Starting from the idea that as the tests become more specific the code becomes more general, it proposes a sequence of the type of transformations that we can apply every time that we're in the implementation phase, in the transition from red to green.

The development through TDD would have two main parts:

* In the first one we build the class' public interface, defining how we're going to communicate with it, and how it's going to answer us. We analyze this question in it's most generic way, which would be the data type that it returns.
* In the second part we develop the behavior, starting from the most general cases, and introducing the more specific ones later.

Let's see this with a practical example. We'll perform the Roman Numerals kata paying attention to how the tests help up guide these two parts.

## Constructing the public interface of a test driven class

We'll always start with a test that forces us to define the class, as for now we don't need anything else than an object with which to interact.

```kotlin
package org.talkingbit.kata

import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test

class RomanNumeralsTest {proposes

    @Test
    fun `Should convert numbers to roman` () {
        RomanNumerals()
    }
}
```

We run the test to see it fail, and the, we write the empty class definition, the minimum necessary to pass the test.

```kotlin
package org.talkingbit.kata

class RomanNumerals {

}
```

If we've created it in the same file as the test, now we can move it to its place during the refactoring phase.

We can already think about the second test, which we need to define the public interface, that it: how we're going to communicate with the object once it's instantiated, and what messages it's going to be able to understand:

```kotlin
package org.talkingbit.kata

import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test

class RomanNumeralsTest {

    @Test
    fun `It converts numbers to roman` () {
        RomanNumerals().toRoman()
    }
}
```

We're modifying the first test. Now that we have some fluency we can afford this kind of licenses, so writing new tests is more inexpensive. Well, we check that it fails for the reason that it has to fail (the `toRoman` message is not defined), and next we write the necessary code to make it pass. The compiler helps us: if we run the test we'll see that it throws an exception that tells us that the method exists but it's not implemented. And probably the IDE tells us something about it too, one way or another. Kotlin, which is the language that we're working with here, ask us directly to implement it:

```kotlin
package org.talkingbit.kata

class RomanNumerals {
    fun toRoman() {
        TODO("Not yet implemented")
    }
}
```

For now, we remove these indications introduced by the IDE:

```kotlin
package org.talkingbit.kata

class RomanNumerals {
    fun toRoman() {
    }
}
```

And this passes the test. We already have the message with which we're going to ask `RomanNumerals` to do the conversion. The next step can be to define that the response we expect should be a `String`. If we work with dynamic typing or *Duck Typing* we'll need a specific test. However, in Kotlin we can do it without tets. It's enough to specify the return type of the function:

```kotlin
package org.talkingbit.kata

class RomanNumerals {
    fun toRoman(): String {
    }
}
```

This won't compile and our current test will fail, so the way to make it pass would be to return any `String`. Even an empty one.

```kotlin
package org.talkingbit.kata

class RomanNumerals {
    fun toRoman(): String {
        return "";
    }
}
```

We may consider this as a refactoring up to a certain point, but we can apply it as if it were a test.

Now we're going to think about how to use this code to convert arabic numbers to roman notation. Since there is no zero in the latter, we have to start with number 1.

```kotlin
package org.talkingbit.kata

import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test

class RomanNumeralsTest {

    @Test
    fun `Should convert numbers to roman` () {
        RomanNumerals().toRoman(1)
    }
}
```

When we run the test, we can see that it fails because the function doesn't expect an argument, so we add it:

```kotlin
package org.talkingbit.kata

class RomanNumerals {
    fun toRoman(decimal: Int): String {
        return "";
    }
}
```

And this passes the test. The public interface has been defined, but we still don't have any behavior.

I> This way of building the class may not work the same in other languages. In this example, Kotlin is not able to execute a module if we pass it a parameter that it doesn't specifically ask for. This lets us write a test of this kind in order to force its implementation. However, a different language like PHP wouldn't care, so we would have to resort to other type of test to force ourselves to introduce the parameter. Therefore, keep in mind these details about the language that you're practicing with: some of them will even save you from writing some tests.

## Drive the development of a behavior through examples

Once we've established the public interface of the class that we're developing, we'll want to start implementing its behavior. We need a first example, which for this exercise will be to convert the `1` into `I`.

To do this, we already need to assign the value to a variable and use an assertion. The test will end up like this:

```kotlin
package org.talkingbit.kata

import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test
import kotlin.test.assertEquals

class RomanNumeralsTest {

    @Test
    fun `Should convert numbers to roman` () {
        var roman = RomanNumerals().toRoman(1)

        assertEquals("I", roman)
    }
}
```

### From null to constant

Right now, `RomanNumerals().toRoman(1)` returns `""`, which for all intents and purposes is equivalent to returning `null`.

What is the simplest transformation that we can make to make the test pass? In few words, we go from not returning anything to returning something, and to pass the test, that something ought to be the value "I". That is, a constant:

```kotlin
package org.talkingbit.kata

class RomanNumerals {
    fun toRoman(number: Int): String {
        return "I"
    }
}
```

The test passes. This solution might shock you if it's your first time peeking at TDD, although if you're reading this book you'll have already seen more examples of this. But this solution is not stupid.

In fact, this is the best solution for the current state of the test. We may know that we want to build an arabic to roman numeral converter, but what the test specifies here and now is just that we expect our code to convert the integer `1` to the String `I`. And that's exactly what it does.

Therefore, the implementation has exactly the necessary complexity and specificity level. What we're going to do next will be to question it with another example.

But first, we should do a refactoring.

We'll do it to prepare for what comes next. When we change the example, the response will have to change as well. So, we're going to do two things: use the parameter that we receive, and, at the same time, ensure that this test will always pass:

```kotlin
package org.talkingbit.kata

class RomanNumerals {
    fun toRoman(number: Int): String {
        if (number == 1) return "I"
        return ""
    }
}
```

We run the test, which should pass without any issues. Moreover, we'll make a small adjustment to the test itself:

```kotlin
package org.talkingbit.kata

import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test
import kotlin.test.assertEquals

class RomanNumeralsTest {

    @Test
    fun `Should convert numbers to roman` () {

        assertEquals("I", RomanNumerals().toRoman(1))
    }
}

```

The test continues to pass and we are already left with nothing to do, so we're going to introduce a new example (something that is now easier to do):

```kotlin
package org.talkingbit.kata

import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test
import kotlin.test.assertEquals

class RomanNumeralsTest {

    @Test
    fun `Should convert numbers to roman` () {
        assertEquals("I", RomanNumerals().toRoman(1))
        assertEquals("II", RomanNumerals().toRoman(2))
    }
}
```

When we run the test we check that it fails because it doesn't return the expected `II`. A way to make it pass is the following:

```kotlin
package org.talkingbit.kata

class RomanNumerals {
    fun toRoman(number: Int): String {
        if (number == 2) return "II"
        if (number == 1) return "I"
        return ""
    }
}
```

Note that, for now, we're returning constants in all cases.

Let's refactor, as we're in green. First we refactor the test to make it even more compact, and easier to read and extend with examples.

```kotlin
package org.talkingbit.kata

import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test
import kotlin.test.assertEquals

class RomanNumeralsTest {

    @Test
    fun `Should convert numbers to roman` () {
        assertConvertsToRoman(1, "I")
        assertConvertsToRoman(2, "II")
    }

    private fun assertConvertsToRoman(arabic: Int, roman: String) {
        assertEquals(roman, RomanNumerals().toRoman(arabic))
    }
}
```

We add yet another test. Now it's even easier:

```kotlin
package org.talkingbit.kata

import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test
import kotlin.test.assertEquals

class RomanNumeralsTest {

    @Test
    fun `Should convert numbers to roman` () {
        assertConvertsToRoman(1, "I")
        assertConvertsToRoman(2, "II")
        assertConvertsToRoman(3, "III")
    }

    private fun assertConvertsToRoman(arabic: Int, roman: String) {
        assertEquals(roman, RomanNumerals().toRoman(arabic))
    }
}
```

We see it fail, and, to make it pass, we add a new constant:

```kotlin
package org.talkingbit.kata

class RomanNumerals {
    fun toRoman(number: Int): String {
        if (number == 3) return "III"
        if (number == 2) return "II"
        if (number == 1) return "I"
        return ""
    }
}
```

And now, expressing the same, but in a different manner and using only one constant:

```kotlin
package org.talkingbit.kata

class RomanNumerals {
    fun toRoman(number: Int): String {
        if (number == 3) return "I" + "I" + "I"
        if (number == 2) return "I" + "I"
        if (number == 1) return "I"
        return ""
    }
}
```

We could extract it:

```kotlin
package org.talkingbit.kata

class RomanNumerals {
    fun toRoman(number: Int): String {
        val i = "I"
        if (number == 3) roman = i + i + i
        if (number == 2) roman = i + i
        if (number == 1) roman = i
        return ""
    }
}
```

And now it's easy to see how we could introduce a new transformation.

### From constant to variable

This transformation consists in using a variable to generate the response. That is, now instead of returning a fixed value for each example, we're going to calculate the appropriate response. Basically, we've started to build an algorithm.

```kotlin
package org.talkingbit.kata

class RomanNumerals {
    fun toRoman(number: Int): String {
        val i = "I"
        var roman = ""
        if (number == 3) roman = i + i + i
        if (number == 2) roman = i + i
        if (number == 1) roman = i

        return roman
    }
}
```

This transformation makes it clear that the algorithm consists in piling up as many `I` as `number` indicates. A way of seeing it:

```kotlin
package org.talkingbit.kata

class RomanNumerals {
    fun toRoman(number: Int): String {
        val i = "I"
        var roman = ""
        for (counter in 1..number) {
            roman += i
        }
        return roman
    }
}
```

This `for` loop could be better expressed as a `while`, but first we have to make a change. It should be noted that the parameters in Kotlin are `final`, so we can't modify them. For this reason, we've had to introduce a variable and initialize it to the value of the parameter.

```kotlin
package org.talkingbit.kata

class RomanNumerals {
    fun toRoman(number: Int): String {
        var arabic = number
        val i = "I"
        var roman = ""
        while (arabic >= 1) {
            roman += i
            arabic -= 1
        }

        return roman
    }
}
```

On the other hand, since the `i` constant is only used once and its meaning is pretty evident, we're going to remove it.

```kotlin
package org.talkingbit.kata

class RomanNumerals {
    fun toRoman(number: Int): String {
        var arabic = number
        var roman = ""
        while (arabic >= 1) {
            roman += "I"
            arabic -= 1
        }

        return roman
    }
}
```

This way we've started to build a more general solution to the algorithm, at least up to the point that's currently defined by the tests. As we know, it's not "legal" to accumulate more than 3 equal symbols in the roman notation, so in it's current state, the algorithm will generate the wrong roman representations if we use it on any number larger than 3.

This indicates that we need a new test to be able to incorporate a new behavior and develop the algorithm further, which is still very specific.

But, what is the next example that we could implement?


### From unconditional to conditional

In the first first place we got number 4, which in roman notation is expressed as `IV`. It introduces a new symbol, which is a combination of symbols in itself. For all we know it's just a particular case, so we introduce a conditional to separate the flow into two branches: one for the behavior that we already know, and other for the new one.

```kotlin
package org.talkingbit.kata

import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test
import kotlin.test.assertEquals

class RomanNumeralsTest {

    @Test
    fun `Should convert numbers to roman` () {
        assertConvertsToRoman(1, "I")
        assertConvertsToRoman(2, "II")
        assertConvertsToRoman(3, "III")
        assertConvertsToRoman(4, "IV")
    }

    private fun assertConvertsToRoman(arabic: Int, roman: String) {
        assertEquals(roman, RomanNumerals().toRoman(arabic))
    }
}
``` 

The test will fail because it tries to convert the number 4 to `IIII`. We introduce the conditional to handle this particular case.

```kotlin
package org.talkingbit.kata

class RomanNumerals {
    fun toRoman(number: Int): String {
        var arabic = number
        var roman = ""

        if (arabic == 4) {
            roman = "IV"
        }

        while (arabic >= 1) {
            roman += "I"
            arabic -= 1
        }

        return roman
    }
}
```

Oops. The test fails because we have forgotten to subtract the consumed value. We fix it like this, and we leave a note for our future selves:


```kotlin
package org.talkingbit.kata

class RomanNumerals {
    fun toRoman(number: Int): String {
        var arabic = number
        var roman = ""

        if (arabic == 4) {
            roman = "IV"
            arabic -= 4
        }

        while (arabic >= 1) {
            roman += "I"
            arabic -= 1
        }

        return roman
    }
}
```

We advance to a new number:

```kotlin
package org.talkingbit.kata

import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test
import kotlin.test.assertEquals

class RomanNumeralsTest {

    @Test
    fun `Should convert numbers to roman` () {
        assertConvertsToRoman(1, "I")
        assertConvertsToRoman(2, "II")
        assertConvertsToRoman(3, "III")
        assertConvertsToRoman(4, "IV")
        assertConvertsToRoman(5, "V")
    }

    private fun assertConvertsToRoman(arabic: Int, roman: String) {
        assertEquals(roman, RomanNumerals().toRoman(arabic))
    }
}
```

We check that the test fails for the expected reasons and we get `IIIII` as a result. To make it pass we'll take another path, introducing a new conditional because it's a new different case. This time we don't forget to subtract the value of 5.

```kotlin
package org.talkingbit.kata

class RomanNumerals {
    fun toRoman(number: Int): String {
        var arabic = number
        var roman = ""

        if (arabic == 5) {
            roman = "V"
            arabic -= 5
        }

        if (arabic == 4) {
            roman = "IV"
            arabic -= 4
        }

        while (arabic >= 1) {
            roman += "I"
            arabic -= 1
        }

        return roman
    }
}
```

The truth is that we had already used conditional before, when our responses were constant, to choose "which constant to return", so to speak. Now we introduce the conditional in order to be able to handle new case families, as we've already exhausted the capabilities of the existing code to solve the new cases that we're introducing. And within that execution branch that didn't exist before, we resort to a constant again in order to solve it.

We introduce a new failing test to force another algorithm advance:

```kotlin
package org.talkingbit.kata

import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test
import kotlin.test.assertEquals

class RomanNumeralsTest {

    @Test
    fun `Should convert numbers to roman` () {
        assertConvertsToRoman(1, "I")
        assertConvertsToRoman(2, "II")
        assertConvertsToRoman(3, "III")
        assertConvertsToRoman(3, "IV")
        assertConvertsToRoman(5, "V")
        assertConvertsToRoman(6, "VI")
    }

    private fun assertConvertsToRoman(arabic: Int, roman: String) {
        assertEquals(roman, RomanNumerals().toRoman(arabic))
    }
}
```

This case is especially interesting to see fail:

```
expected:<[V]I> but was:<[IIIII]I>
Expected :VI
Actual   :IIIIII
```

We need to include the "V" symbol, something that we can do in a very simple way by changing the `==` for a `>=`.

```kotlin
package org.talkingbit.kata

class RomanNumerals {
    fun toRoman(number: Int): String {
        var arabic = number
        var roman = ""

        if (arabic >= 5) {
            roman = "V"
            arabic -= 5
        }

        if (arabic == 4) {
            roman = "IV"
            arabic -= 4
        }

        while (arabic >= 1) {
            roman += "I"
            arabic -= 1
        }

        return roman
    }
}
```

A minimal change has sufficed to make the test pass. The next two examples pass without any extra effort:

```kotlin
package org.talkingbit.kata

import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test
import kotlin.test.assertEquals

class RomanNumeralsTest {

    @Test
    fun `Should convert numbers to roman` () {
        assertConvertsToRoman(1, "I")
        assertConvertsToRoman(2, "II")
        assertConvertsToRoman(3, "III")
        assertConvertsToRoman(4, "IV")
        assertConvertsToRoman(5, "V")
        assertConvertsToRoman(6, "VI")
        assertConvertsToRoman(7, "VII")
        assertConvertsToRoman(8, "VIII")
    }

    private fun assertConvertsToRoman(arabic: Int, roman: String) {
        assertEquals(roman, RomanNumerals().toRoman(arabic))
    }
}
```

This happens because our current algorithm is already general enough to be able to handle these cases. However, when we introduce the `9`, we face a different casuistry:

```kotlin
package org.talkingbit.kata

import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test
import kotlin.test.assertEquals

class RomanNumeralsTest {

    @Test
    fun `Should convert numbers to roman` () {
        assertConvertsToRoman(1, "I")
        assertConvertsToRoman(2, "II")
        assertConvertsToRoman(3, "III")
        assertConvertsToRoman(4, "IV")
        assertConvertsToRoman(5, "V")
        assertConvertsToRoman(6, "VI")
        assertConvertsToRoman(7, "VII")
        assertConvertsToRoman(8, "VIII")
        assertConvertsToRoman(9, "IX")
    }

    private fun assertConvertsToRoman(arabic: Int, roman: String) {
        assertEquals(roman, RomanNumerals().toRoman(arabic))
    }
}
```

The result is:

```
expected:<I[X]> but was:<I[V]>
Expected :IX
Actual   :IV
```

We need a specific treatment, so we add a conditional for the new case:

```kotlin
package org.talkingbit.kata

class RomanNumerals {
    fun toRoman(number: Int): String {
        var arabic = number
        var roman = ""

        if (arabic == 9) {
            roman = "IX"
            arabic -= 9
        }

        if (arabic >= 5) {
            roman = "V"
            arabic -= 5
        }

        if (arabic == 4) {
            roman = "IV"
            arabic -= 4
        }

        while (arabic >= 1) {
            roman += "I"
            arabic -= 1
        }

        return roman
    }
}
```

We keep running through the examples:

```kotlin
package org.talkingbit.kata

import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test
import kotlin.test.assertEquals

class RomanNumeralsTest {

    @Test
    fun `Should convert numbers to roman` () {
        assertConvertsToRoman(1, "I")
        assertConvertsToRoman(2, "II")
        assertConvertsToRoman(3, "III")
        assertConvertsToRoman(4, "IV")
        assertConvertsToRoman(5, "V")
        assertConvertsToRoman(6, "VI")
        assertConvertsToRoman(7, "VII")
        assertConvertsToRoman(8, "VIII")
        assertConvertsToRoman(9, "IX")
        assertConvertsToRoman(10, "X")
    }

    private fun assertConvertsToRoman(arabic: Int, roman: String) {
        assertEquals(roman, RomanNumerals().toRoman(arabic))
    }
}
```

Being it a new symbol, we handle it in a special manner:

```kotlin
package org.talkingbit.kata

class RomanNumerals {
    fun toRoman(number: Int): String {
        var arabic = number
        var roman = ""

        if (arabic == 10) {
            roman = "X"
            arabic -= 10
        }

        if (arabic == 9) {
            roman = "IX"
            arabic -= 9
        }

        if (arabic >= 5) {
            roman = "V"
            arabic -= 5
        }

        if (arabic == 4) {
            roman = "IV"
            arabic -= 4
        }

        while (arabic >= 1) {
            roman += "I"
            arabic -= 1
        }

        return roman
    }
}
```

If we take a look at the production code we can identify structures that are similar between them, but we can't clearly see a pattern that we could refactor and generalize. Maybe we need more information. Let's proceed to the next case:

```kotlin
package org.talkingbit.kata

import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test
import kotlin.test.assertEquals

class RomanNumeralsTest {

    @Test
    fun `Should convert numbers to roman` () {
        assertConvertsToRoman(1, "I")
        assertConvertsToRoman(2, "II")
        assertConvertsToRoman(3, "III")
        assertConvertsToRoman(4, "IV")
        assertConvertsToRoman(5, "V")
        assertConvertsToRoman(6, "VI")
        assertConvertsToRoman(7, "VII")
        assertConvertsToRoman(8, "VIII")
        assertConvertsToRoman(9, "IX")
        assertConvertsToRoman(10, "X")
        assertConvertsToRoman(11, "XI")
    }

    private fun assertConvertsToRoman(arabic: Int, roman: String) {
        assertEquals(roman, RomanNumerals().toRoman(arabic))
    }
}
```

This test results in:

```
expected:<[X]I> but was:<[VIIIII]I>
Expected :XI
Actual   :VIIIIII
```

To begin, we need to enter the "X" symbol's conditional, so we make this change:

```kotlin
package org.talkingbit.kata

class RomanNumerals {
    fun toRoman(number: Int): String {
        var arabic = number
        var roman = ""

        if (arabic >= 10) {
            roman = "X"
            arabic -= 10
        }

        if (arabic == 9) {
            roman = "IX"
            arabic -= 9
        }

        if (arabic >= 5) {
            roman = "V"
            arabic -= 5
        }

        if (arabic == 4) {
            roman = "IV"
            arabic -= 4
        }

        while (arabic >= 1) {
            roman += "I"
            arabic -= 1
        }

        return roman
    }
}
```

And this is enough to make the test pass. With numbers 12 and 13 the test continues to pass, but when we reach 14, something happens:

```kotlin
package org.talkingbit.kata

import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test
import kotlin.test.assertEquals

class RomanNumeralsTest {

    @Test
    fun `Should convert numbers to roman` () {
        assertConvertsToRoman(1, "I")
        assertConvertsToRoman(2, "II")
        assertConvertsToRoman(3, "III")
        assertConvertsToRoman(4, "IV")
        assertConvertsToRoman(5, "V")
        assertConvertsToRoman(6, "VI")
        assertConvertsToRoman(7, "VII")
        assertConvertsToRoman(8, "VIII")
        assertConvertsToRoman(9, "IX")
        assertConvertsToRoman(10, "X")
        assertConvertsToRoman(11, "XI")
        assertConvertsToRoman(12, "XII")
        assertConvertsToRoman(13, "XIII")
        assertConvertsToRoman(14, "XIV")
    }

    private fun assertConvertsToRoman(arabic: Int, roman: String) {
        assertEquals(roman, RomanNumerals().toRoman(arabic))
    }
}
```

The result is:

```
expected:<[X]IV> but was:<[]IV>
Expected :XIV
Actual   :IV
```

This happens because we're not accumulating the roman notation in the return variable, so in some cases we *crush* the existing result. Let's change from a simple assignment to an expression:

```kotlin
package org.talkingbit.kata

class RomanNumerals {
    fun toRoman(number: Int): String {
        var arabic = number
        var roman = ""

        if (arabic >= 10) {
            roman = "X"
            arabic -= 10
        }

        if (arabic == 9) {
            roman = "IX"
            arabic -= 9
        }

        if (arabic >= 5) {
            roman = "V"
            arabic -= 5
        }

        if (arabic == 4) {
            roman += "IV"
            arabic -= 4
        }

        while (arabic >= 1) {
            roman += "I"
            arabic -= 1
        }

        return roman
    }
}
```

This discovery hints that we could try some specific examples with which to manifest this problem and solve it for other numbers, such as 15.

```kotlin
package org.talkingbit.kata

import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test
import kotlin.test.assertEquals

class RomanNumeralsTest {

    @Test
    fun `Should convert numbers to roman` () {
        assertConvertsToRoman(1, "I")
        assertConvertsToRoman(2, "II")
        assertConvertsToRoman(3, "III")
        assertConvertsToRoman(4, "IV")
        assertConvertsToRoman(5, "V")
        assertConvertsToRoman(6, "VI")
        assertConvertsToRoman(7, "VII")
        assertConvertsToRoman(8, "VIII")
        assertConvertsToRoman(9, "IX")
        assertConvertsToRoman(10, "X")
        assertConvertsToRoman(11, "XI")
        assertConvertsToRoman(12, "XII")
        assertConvertsToRoman(13, "XIII")
        assertConvertsToRoman(14, "XIV")
        assertConvertsToRoman(15, "XV")
    }

    private fun assertConvertsToRoman(arabic: Int, roman: String) {
        assertEquals(roman, RomanNumerals().toRoman(arabic))
    }
}
```

And we apply the same change:

```kotlin
package org.talkingbit.kata

class RomanNumerals {
    fun toRoman(number: Int): String {
        var arabic = number
        var roman = ""

        if (arabic >= 10) {
            roman = "X"
            arabic -= 10
        }

        if (arabic == 9) {
            roman = "IX"
            arabic -= 9
        }

        if (arabic >= 5) {
            roman += "V"
            arabic -= 5
        }

        if (arabic == 4) {
            roman += "IV"
            arabic -= 4
        }

        while (arabic >= 1) {
            roman += "I"
            arabic -= 1
        }

        return roman
    }
}
```

19 also has the same solution. But if we try 20, we'll see a new error, a rather curious one:

```kotlin
package org.talkingbit.kata

import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test
import kotlin.test.assertEquals

class RomanNumeralsTest {

    @Test
    fun `Should convert numbers to roman` () {
        assertConvertsToRoman(1, "I")
        assertConvertsToRoman(2, "II")
        assertConvertsToRoman(3, "III")
        assertConvertsToRoman(4, "IV")
        assertConvertsToRoman(5, "V")
        assertConvertsToRoman(6, "VI")
        assertConvertsToRoman(7, "VII")
        assertConvertsToRoman(8, "VIII")
        assertConvertsToRoman(9, "IX")
        assertConvertsToRoman(10, "X")
        assertConvertsToRoman(11, "XI")
        assertConvertsToRoman(12, "XII")
        assertConvertsToRoman(13, "XIII")
        assertConvertsToRoman(14, "XIV")
        assertConvertsToRoman(15, "XV")
        assertConvertsToRoman(19, "XIX")
        assertConvertsToRoman(20, "XX")
    }

    private fun assertConvertsToRoman(arabic: Int, roman: String) {
        assertEquals(roman, RomanNumerals().toRoman(arabic))
    }
}
```

This is the result:

```
expected:<X[X]> but was:<X[VIIIII]>
Expected :XX
Actual   :XVIIIII
```

The problem is that we need to replace all of the `10` that are contained in the number by `X`.

### Changing from if to while
 
To handle this case, the simplest thing to do is changing the `if` to a `while`. `while`is an structure that is both a conditional and a loop at the same time. `if` executes the conditioned branch only once, but `while` does it as long as the condition continues to be met.

```kotlin
package org.talkingbit.kata

class RomanNumerals {
    fun toRoman(number: Int): String {
        var arabic = number
        var roman = ""

        while (arabic >= 10) {
            roman += "X"
            arabic -= 10
        }

        if (arabic == 9) {
            roman += "IX"
            arabic -= 9
        }

        if (arabic >= 5) {
            roman += "V"
            arabic -= 5
        }

        if (arabic == 4) {
            roman += "IV"
            arabic -= 4
        }

        while (arabic >= 1) {
            roman += "I"
            arabic -= 1
        }

        return roman
    }
}
```

Could we use `while` in all cases?NOw that we're in green, we'll try to change all of the conditions from `if` to `while`. And the tests prove that it's possible to do so:

```kotlin
package org.talkingbit.kata

class RomanNumerals {
    fun toRoman(number: Int): String {
        var arabic = number
        var roman = ""

        while (arabic >= 10) {
            roman += "X"
            arabic -= 10
        }

        while (arabic == 9) {
            roman += "IX"
            arabic -= 9
        }

        while (arabic >= 5) {
            roman += "V"
            arabic -= 5
        }

        while (arabic == 4) {
            roman += "IV"
            arabic -= 4
        }

        while (arabic >= 1) {
            roman += "I"
            arabic -= 1
        }

        return roman
    }
}
```

This is interesting, we can see that the structure get more similar each time. Let's try changing the cases in which we use an equality to see if we can use `>=` in its place.

```kotlin
package org.talkingbit.kata

class RomanNumerals {
    fun toRoman(number: Int): String {
        var arabic = number
        var roman = ""

        while (arabic >= 10) {
            roman += "X"
            arabic -= 10
        }

        while (arabic >= 9) {
            roman += "IX"
            arabic -= 9
        }

        while (arabic >= 5) {
            roman += "V"
            arabic -= 5
        }

        while (arabic >= 4) {
            roman += "IV"
            arabic -= 4
        }

        while (arabic >= 1) {
            roman += "I"
            arabic -= 1
        }

        return roman
    }
}
```

And the tests keep on passing. This indicates a possible refactoring to unify the code.

### Introducing arrays (or collections)

It's a big refactoring, the one that we're going to do here in just one step. Basically, it consists in introducing a dictionary structure (`Map`, in Kotlin), that contains the various conversion rules:

```kotlin
package org.talkingbit.kata

class RomanNumerals {
    fun toRoman(number: Int): String {
        var arabic = number
        var roman = ""

        val symbols = mapOf(
                10 to "X",
                9 to "IX",
                5 to "V",
                4 to "IV",
                1 to "I"
        )

        for ((subtrahend, symbol) in symbols) {
            while (arabic >= subtrahend) {
                roman += symbol
                arabic -= subtrahend
            }
        }

        return roman
    }
}
```

The tests continue to pass, indication that our refactoring is correct. In fact, we wouldn't have any error until reaching number `39`. Something to be expected, as we introduce a new symbol:

```kotlin
package org.talkingbit.kata

import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test
import kotlin.test.assertEquals

class RomanNumeralsTest {

    @Test
    fun `Should convert numbers to roman` () {
        assertConvertsToRoman(1, "I")
        assertConvertsToRoman(2, "II")
        assertConvertsToRoman(3, "III")
        assertConvertsToRoman(4, "IV")
        assertConvertsToRoman(5, "V")
        assertConvertsToRoman(6, "VI")
        assertConvertsToRoman(7, "VII")
        assertConvertsToRoman(8, "VIII")
        assertConvertsToRoman(9, "IX")
        assertConvertsToRoman(10, "X")
        assertConvertsToRoman(11, "XI")
        assertConvertsToRoman(12, "XII")
        assertConvertsToRoman(13, "XIII")
        assertConvertsToRoman(14, "XIV")
        assertConvertsToRoman(15, "XV")
        assertConvertsToRoman(19, "XIX")
        assertConvertsToRoman(20, "XX")
        assertConvertsToRoman(40, "XL")
    }

    private fun assertConvertsToRoman(arabic: Int, roman: String) {
        assertEquals(roman, RomanNumerals().toRoman(arabic))
    }
}
```

The implementation is simple now:

```kotlin
package org.talkingbit.kata

class RomanNumerals {
    fun toRoman(number: Int): String {
        var arabic = number
        var roman = ""

        val symbols = mapOf(
                40 to "XL",
                10 to "X",
                9 to "IX",
                5 to "V",
                4 to "IV",
                1 to "I"
        )

        for ((subtrahend, symbol) in symbols) {
            while (arabic >= subtrahend) {
                roman += symbol
                arabic -= subtrahend
            }
        }

        return roman
    }
}
```

And now that we've checked that it's working properly, we move it to a better place:

```kotlin
package org.talkingbit.kata

class RomanNumerals {
    private val symbols: Map<Int, String> = mapOf(
            40 to "XL",
            10 to "X",
            9 to "IX",
            5 to "V",
            4 to "IV",
            1 to "I"
    )

    fun toRoman(number: Int): String {
        var arabic = number
        var roman = ""

        for ((subtrahend, symbol) in symbols) {
            while (arabic >= subtrahend) {
                roman += symbol
                arabic -= subtrahend
            }
        }

        return roman
    }
}
```

We could keep adding examples that are not yet covered in order to add the remaining transformation rules, but essentially, this algorithm isn't going to change anymore, so we're reached a general solution to convert any natural number to roman notation. In fact, this is how it would end up. The necessary tests, first:

```kotlin
package org.talkingbit.kata

import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test
import kotlin.test.assertEquals

class RomanNumeralsTest {

    @Test
    fun `Should convert numbers to roman` () {
        assertConvertsToRoman(1, "I")
        assertConvertsToRoman(2, "II")
        assertConvertsToRoman(3, "III")
        assertConvertsToRoman(4, "IV")
        assertConvertsToRoman(5, "V")
        assertConvertsToRoman(6, "VI")
        assertConvertsToRoman(7, "VII")
        assertConvertsToRoman(8, "VIII")
        assertConvertsToRoman(9, "IX")
        assertConvertsToRoman(10, "X")
        assertConvertsToRoman(11, "XI")
        assertConvertsToRoman(12, "XII")
        assertConvertsToRoman(13, "XIII")
        assertConvertsToRoman(14, "XIV")
        assertConvertsToRoman(15, "XV")
        assertConvertsToRoman(19, "XIX")
        assertConvertsToRoman(20, "XX")
        assertConvertsToRoman(40, "XL")
        assertConvertsToRoman(50, "L")
        assertConvertsToRoman(90, "XC")
        assertConvertsToRoman(100, "C")
        assertConvertsToRoman(400, "CD")
        assertConvertsToRoman(500, "D")
        assertConvertsToRoman(900, "CM")
        assertConvertsToRoman(1000, "M")
    }

    private fun assertConvertsToRoman(arabic: Int, roman: String) {
        assertEquals(roman, RomanNumerals().toRoman(arabic))
    }
}
```

And the implementation:

```kotlin
package org.talkingbit.kata

class RomanNumerals {
    private val symbols: Map<Int, String> = mapOf(
            1000 to "M",
            900 to "CM",
            500 to "D",
            400 to "CD",
            100 to "C",
            90 to "XC",
            50 to "L",
            40 to "XL",
            10 to "X",
            9 to "IX",
            5 to "V",
            4 to "IV",
            1 to "I"
    )

    fun toRoman(number: Int): String {
        var arabic = number
        var roman = ""

        for ((subtrahend, symbol) in symbols) {
            while (arabic >= subtrahend) {
                roman += symbol
                arabic -= subtrahend
            }
        }

        return roman
    }
}
```

We could try several acceptance tests to verify that it's possible to generate any roman number:

```kotlin
        assertConvertsToRoman(623, "DCXXIII")
        assertConvertsToRoman(1714, "MDCCXIV")
        assertConvertsToRoman(2938, "MMCMXXXVIII")
```

Small production code transformation can result in big behavioral changes, although to do that we'll need to spend some time on the refactoring, so that the introduction of changes is as simple as possible.
