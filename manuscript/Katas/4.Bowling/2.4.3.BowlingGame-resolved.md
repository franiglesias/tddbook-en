# Solving the Bowling Game kata

## Statement of the kata

The kata consists in creating a program to calculate the scores of a Bowling game, although to avoid complicating it too much, only the final result is calculated without performing any validations.

A brief remainder of the rules:

* Each game has 10 *frames*, each one with 2 rolls.
* In each turn, the knocked down bowls are counted, and that number is the score
    * 0 points is a *gutter*
    * If all the pins are knocked down in two rolls, it's called a *spare*, and the score of the next roll is added as a bonus
    * If all the pins are knocked down in just one roll, it's called a *strike*, and the score of the next two rolls is added as a bonus
* If a *strike* or *spare* are achieved in the last *frame*, there are extra rolls.

## Language and approach

To do this kata, I've chose Ruby and RSpec. You may notice that I have a certain preference towards the *Spec family testing frameworks. The thing is that they have been designed with TDD in mind, considering the tests as specifications, which helps a lot to escape the mindset of thinking about the tests as QA.

Having said that, there's no problem in using any other testing *framework*, such as those from the *Unit family.

On the other hand, we'll use object oriented programming.

## Starting the game

At this point, the first test should be enough to force us to define and instantiate the class:

```ruby
require 'rspec'

RSpec.describe 'A Bowling Game' do
  it 'should start a new game' do
    BowlingGame.new
  end
end
```

The test will fail, forcing us to write the minimum production code necessary to make it pass.

```ruby
class BowlingGame

end
```

And once we've made the test pass, we move the class to its own file, and make the test require it:

```ruby
require 'rspec'
require_relative '../src/bowling_game'

RSpec.describe 'A Bowling Game' do
  it 'should start a new game' do
    BowlingGame.new
  end
end
```

We're ready for the next test.

## Let's throw the ball

For our `BowlingGame` to be useful, we'll need at least two things:

* A way to indicate the result of a roll, passing the number of knocked down pins, which would be a *command* A *command* results in an effect in the state of an object, but doesn't return anything. We'll need an alternative way to observe that effect.
* A way to obtain the score at a given moment, which would be a *query*. A *query* returns an answer, so we can verify that it's the one that we expect.

You may be wondering: which of the two should we tackle first?

There is not a fixed rule, but a of seeing it could be the following:

Query methods return a result, so their effect can be tested, but we have to make sure that the returned responses won't make it harder for us to create new failing tests.

On the other hand, command methods are easy to introduce with a minimum amount of code without having to worry about their effect in future tests, except from making sure that the parameters that they receive are valid.

So, we're going to start by introducing a method to throw the ball, which simply expects to receive the number of knocked down pins, which can be 0. But to force that, we must first write a test:

```ruby
require 'rspec'
require_relative '../src/bowling_game'

RSpec.describe 'A Bowling Game' do
  it 'should start a new game' do
    game = BowlingGame.new
  end

  it 'should roll a ball knocking down 0 pins' do
    game = BowlingGame.new
    game.roll 0
  end
end
```

And the minimum necessary code to make the test pass is, simply, the definition of the method. Basically, we can now communicate to `BowlingGame` that we've thrown the ball.

```ruby
class BowlingGame
  def roll(pins_down)

  end
end
```

## Time to refactor

In this kata, we'll pay special attention to the refactoring phase. We have strike find a balance so that certain refactorings don't condition our chances to make the code evolve. In the same way that premature optimization is a *smell*, premature over-engineering also is.

The production code doesn't offer any refactoring opportunity yet, but the tests start showing a pattern. The `game` object could live as an instance variable, and be initialized in a `setup` method of the specification or test case. Here, we use `before`.

```ruby
require 'rspec'
require_relative '../src/bowling_game'

RSpec.describe 'A Bowling Game' do

  before do
    @game = BowlingGame.new
  end

  it 'should start a new game' do
    game = BowlingGame.new
  end

  it 'should roll a ball knocking down 0 pins' do
    @game.roll 0
  end
end
```

And this makes the first test redundant:

```ruby
require 'rspec'
require_relative '../src/bowling_game'

RSpec.describe 'A Bowling Game' do

  before do
    @game = BowlingGame.new
  end

  it 'should roll a ball knocking down 0 pins' do
    @game.roll 0
  end
end
```

With this, the specification will be more manageable.

## Counting the points

It's time to introduce a method that lets us check the game scoreboard. We call it from a failing test:

```ruby
require 'rspec'
require_relative '../src/bowling_game'

RSpec.describe 'A Bowling Game' do

  before do
    @game = BowlingGame.new
  end

  it 'should roll a ball knocking down 0 pins' do
    @game.roll 0
  end

  it 'should score after a gutter roll' do
    @game.roll 0
    expect(@game.score).to eq(0)
  end
end
```

The test will fail, since the *score* method doesn't exist.

```ruby
class BowlingGame
  def roll(pins_down)

  end

  def score
    
  end
end
```

And it will keep failing because it has to return 0. The minimum to make it pass is this:

```ruby
class BowlingGame
  def roll(pins_down)

  end

  def score
    0
  end
end
```

## The world's worst thrower

Many of the solutions of this kata jump directly to the point where they start to define the behavior of `BowlingGame` after the 20 rolls. We've chosen a path of smaller steps, and we're going to see what it entails.

Our next test will try to make it possible to obtain a scoreboard after 20 throws. A way to do it is to simulate them, and the simplest simulation would be to consider all them as failed rolls, that is, not a single pin would be knocked down and the final score would be 0.

This seems like a good test to start with:

```ruby
require 'rspec'
require_relative '../src/bowling_game'

RSpec.describe 'A Bowling Game' do

  before do
    @game = BowlingGame.new
  end

  it 'should roll a ball knocking down 0 pins' do
    @game.roll 0
  end

  it 'should score after a gutter roll' do
    @game.roll 0
    expect(@game.score).to eq(0)
  end

  it 'should score a gutter game' do
    20.times do
      @game.roll 0
    end
    expect(@game.score).to eq(0)
  end
end

```

But it's not. We run it, and it passes in the first try.

This test doesn't force us to introduce any changes in the production code because it doesn't fail. Ultimately, it's the same test that we had before. However, in a way it's a better test, since our objective is to make `score` return the results after all of the rolls.

## Organizing the code

We just remove the previous test for being redundant, as that behavior would already be implicitly contained in the one that we've just defined.

```ruby
require 'rspec'
require_relative '../src/bowling_game'

RSpec.describe 'A Bowling Game' do

  before do
    @game = BowlingGame.new
  end

  it 'should roll a ball knocking down 0 pins' do
    @game.roll 0
  end
  
  it 'should score a gutter game' do
    20.times do
      @game.roll 0
    end
    expect(@game.score).to eq(0)
  end
end
```

As the test hasn't required us to write any production code, we need a test that does fail.

## Teaching our game to count

We need to expect a result different than zero in `score` to be forced to implement new production code. From all the possible results of a complete bowling game, maybe the simplest one to test is the case where every throws only knocks down one pin each. This way, we expect the final score to be 20, and there isn't any chance for extra points or throws to be generated.

```ruby
require 'rspec'
require_relative '../src/bowling_game'

RSpec.describe 'A Bowling Game' do

  before do
    @game = BowlingGame.new
  end

  it 'should roll a ball knocking down 0 pins' do
    @game.roll 0
  end

  it 'should score a gutter game' do
    20.times do
      @game.roll 0
    end
    expect(@game.score).to eq(0)
  end

  it 'should score all ones' do
    20.times do
      @game.roll 1
    end
    expect(@game.score).to eq(20)
  end
end
```

This test already fails because there's nothing counting and accumulating the points of each roll. Therefore, we need to set a variable, which initializes as zero and accumulates the results.

But, hold on a second... Aren't these too many things?

## A step back to reach further

Let's review, to pass the current failing test, we need to:

* Add a variable to the class to store the scores
* Initialize it to 0
* Accumulate the results in it

Those are many things to add in single cycle while having a failing test.

The thing is, actually, we could forget about this test for a moment, and go back to the previous state, when we were still in green. To do so, we comment out the new test so it doesn't get executed.

```ruby
require 'rspec'
require_relative '../src/bowling_game'

RSpec.describe 'A Bowling Game' do

  before do
    @game = BowlingGame.new
  end

  it 'should roll a ball knocking down 0 pins' do
    @game.roll 0
  end

  it 'should score a gutter game' do
    20.times do
      @game.roll 0
    end
    expect(@game.score).to eq(0)
  end

  # it 'should score all ones' do
  #   20.times do
  #     @game.roll 1
  #   end
  #   expect(@game.score).to eq(20)
  # end
end
```

And now we proceed to the refactor. We start by changing the constant 0 by a variable:

```ruby
class BowlingGame
  def roll(pins_down)

  end

  def score
    @score = 0
  end
end
```

We can improve this code, storing the points that were obtained in the throw in the variable. This code still passes the test and involves a minimal change:

```ruby
class BowlingGame
  def roll(pins_down)
    @score = pins_down
  end

  def score
    @score
  end
end
```

## Recovering a cancelled test

Now we do run the fourth test, observing that it fails again:

```ruby
require 'rspec'
require_relative '../src/bowling_game'

RSpec.describe 'A Bowling Game' do

  before do
    @game = BowlingGame.new
  end

  it 'should roll a ball knocking down 0 pins' do
    @game.roll 0
  end

  it 'should score a gutter game' do
    20.times do
      @game.roll 0
    end
    expect(@game.score).to eq(0)
  end

  it 'should score all ones' do
    20.times do
      @game.roll 1
    end
    expect(@game.score).to eq(20)
  end
end
```

The necessary change in the code is smaller now. We have to initialize the variable in construction, so that each game starts at 0 and then accumulates the points. Note that apart from the constructor, it will be enough to add a `+` sign.

```ruby
class BowlingGame

  def initialize
    @score = 0
  end

  def roll(pins_down)
    @score += pins_down
  end

  def score
    @score
  end
end
```

Again in green, knowing that we're already accumulating points.

## Getting more comfortable

If we observe the tests, we see that it might be useful to have a method to roll the ball several times with the same result. So we extract it, and of course, we use it:

```ruby
require 'rspec'
require_relative '../src/bowling_game'

RSpec.describe 'A Bowling Game' do

  before do
    @game = BowlingGame.new
  end

  it 'should roll a ball knocking down 0 pins' do
    @game.roll 0
  end

  it 'should score a gutter game' do
    roll_many 20, 0
    expect(@game.score).to eq(0)
  end

  it 'should score all ones' do
    roll_many 20, 1
    expect(@game.score).to eq(20)
  end

  def roll_many(times, pins_down)
    times.times do
      @game.roll pins_down
    end
  end
end
```

## How to handle a *spare*

Now that we're sure that our BowlingGame is able to accumulate the points achieved in each throw, it's time to keep going. We can start to handle special cases like, for example, how to process a *spare*, that is, knocking down the ten pins with the two rolls that are in a *frame*.

So, we write a test to simulate this situation. The simplest would be to imagine that the *spare* occurs in the first *frame*, and that the result of the third roll is the bonus. To make things easier, the rest of the rolls in the game are 0, so we don't introduce any strange scores.

Here's a possible test:

```ruby
require 'rspec'
require_relative '../src/bowling_game'

RSpec.describe 'A Bowling Game' do

  before do
    @game = BowlingGame.new
  end

  it 'should roll a ball knocking down 0 pins' do
    @game.roll 0
  end

  it 'should score a gutter game' do
    roll_many 20, 0
    expect(@game.score).to eq(0)
  end

  it 'should score all ones' do
    roll_many 20, 1
    expect(@game.score).to eq(20)
  end

  it 'should score an spare' do
    @game.roll 5
    @game.roll 5
    @game.roll 3
    roll_many 17, 0
    expect(@game.score).to eq(16)
  end

  def roll_many(times, pins_down)
    times.times do
      @game.roll pins_down
    end
  end
end
```

The test fails because `score` returns 13 points when the should be 16. Right now, there isn't any mechanism that counts the throw after the *spare* as a bonus.

The problem is that we shouldn't be counting the points by roll, but rather by *frame*, in order to know if a *frame* has resulted in a *spare* or not, and to act consequently. Moreover, now it's not enough to simply add the points. Instead, we have to pass the counting responsibility to the `score` method, so that `roll` is limited to storing the partials, leaving the logic of calculating points at the *frame* level to `score`.

## Introducing the concept of *frame*

First, we go back to the previous test, temporarily cancelling the one that's falling right now:

```ruby
require 'rspec'
require_relative '../src/bowling_game'

RSpec.describe 'A Bowling Game' do

  before do
    @game = BowlingGame.new
  end

  it 'should roll a ball knocking down 0 pins' do
    @game.roll 0
  end

  it 'should score a gutter game' do
    roll_many 20, 0
    expect(@game.score).to eq(0)
  end

  it 'should score all ones' do
    roll_many 20, 1
    expect(@game.score).to eq(20)
  end

  # it 'should score an spare' do
  #   @game.roll 5
  #   @game.roll 5
  #   @game.roll 3
  #   roll_many 17, 0
  #   expect(@game.score).to eq(16)
  # end

  def roll_many(times, pins_down)
    times.times do
      @game.roll pins_down
    end
  end
end
```

Let's refactor. In the first place, we change the name of the variable:

```ruby
class BowlingGame

  def initialize
    @rolls = 0
  end

  def roll(pins_down)
    @rolls += pins_down
  end

  def score
    @rolls
  end
end
```

The tests continue to pass. Now we change its meaning, and move the sum to `score`:

```ruby
class BowlingGame

  def initialize
    @rolls = []
  end

  def roll(pins_down)
    @rolls.push pins_down
  end

  def score
    score = 0
    @rolls.each do |roll|
      score += roll
    end
    score
  end
end
```

We check that the tests keep passing. It could be a good time to introduce the concept of *frame*. We know that there's a maximum of 10 *frames*.

```ruby
class BowlingGame

  def initialize
    @rolls = []
  end

  def roll(pins_down)
    @rolls.push pins_down
  end

  def score
    score = 0
    roll = 0

    10.times do
      frame_score = @rolls[roll] + @rolls[roll+1]
      score += frame_score
      roll += 2
    end
    score
  end
end
```

With this change, the tests still pass, and now we have access to the score by *frame*. It looks like we're ready to reintroduce the previous test.

## Continue handling *spare*

We reactivate the failing test.

```ruby
require 'rspec'
require_relative '../src/bowling_game'

RSpec.describe 'A Bowling Game' do

  before do
    @game = BowlingGame.new
  end

  it 'should roll a ball knocking down 0 pins' do
    @game.roll 0
  end

  it 'should score a gutter game' do
    roll_many 20, 0
    expect(@game.score).to eq(0)
  end

  it 'should score all ones' do
    roll_many 20, 1
    expect(@game.score).to eq(20)
  end

  it 'should score an spare' do
      @game.roll 5
      @game.roll 5
      @game.roll 3
      roll_many 17, 0
      expect(@game.score).to eq(16)
    end

  def roll_many(times, pins_down)
    times.times do
      @game.roll pins_down
    end
  end
end
```

Now we're better set to introduce the desired behavior through a pretty small change:

```ruby
class BowlingGame

  def initialize
    @rolls = []
  end

  def roll(pins_down)
    @rolls.push pins_down
  end

  def score
    score = 0
    roll = 0

    10.times do
      frame_score = @rolls[roll] + @rolls[roll + 1]
      if frame_score == 10
        frame_score += @rolls[roll + 2]
      end
      score += frame_score
      roll += 2
    end
    score
  end
end
```

Adding an `if` block is sufficient to make the test pass.

## Removing magic numbers and other refactorings

At this point, with all tests in green, we can make several improvements to the code. Let's go bit by bit:

Let's give meaning to some magic numbers that are in the production code:

```ruby
class BowlingGame
  
  def initialize
    @rolls = []
  end

  def roll(pins_down)
    @rolls.push pins_down
  end

  FRAMES_IN_A_GAME = 10
  ALL_PINS_DOWN = 10

  def score
    score = 0
    roll = 0

    FRAMES_IN_A_GAME.times do
      frame_score = @rolls[roll] + @rolls[roll + 1]
      if frame_score == ALL_PINS_DOWN
        frame_score += @rolls[roll + 2]
      end
      score += frame_score
      roll += 2
    end
    score
  end
end
```

The calculation of the *frame* score could be extracted to a method, which would save us the temporary variable:

```ruby
class BowlingGame

  def initialize
    @rolls = []
  end

  def roll(pins_down)
    @rolls.push pins_down
  end

  FRAMES_IN_A_GAME = 10
  ALL_PINS_DOWN = 10

  def score
    score = 0
    roll = 0

    FRAMES_IN_A_GAME.times do
      score += frame_score(roll)
      roll += 2
    end
    score
  end

  private

  def frame_score(roll)
    frame_score = @rolls[roll] + @rolls[roll + 1]
    if frame_score == ALL_PINS_DOWN
      frame_score += @rolls[roll + 2]
    end
    frame_score
  end
end
```

We can give meaning to the sum of the points of each of the *frame's* throws, as well as to the question of it being a *spare* or not. Also, we can *rubify* the code a little:

```ruby
class BowlingGame

  def initialize
    @rolls = []
  end

  def roll(pins_down)
    @rolls.push pins_down
  end

  FRAMES_IN_A_GAME = 10
  ALL_PINS_DOWN = 10

  def score
    score = 0
    roll = 0

    FRAMES_IN_A_GAME.times do
      frame_score = base_frame_score(roll)
      frame_score += @rolls[roll + 2] if spare? frame_score
      score += frame_score
      roll += 2
    end
    score
  end

  private

  def spare?(frame_score)
    frame_score == ALL_PINS_DOWN
  end

  def base_frame_score(roll)
    @rolls[roll] + @rolls[roll + 1]
  end
end
```

The truth is that this is crying out to be extracted to a `Frame` class, but we're not going to do it right now, as we could be committing a *smell* due to an excess of design.

On the other hand, looking at the test, we can see some points of improvement. Such as being more explicit in the example:

```ruby
require 'rspec'
require_relative '../src/bowling_game'

RSpec.describe 'A Bowling Game' do

  before do
    @game = BowlingGame.new
  end

  it 'should roll a ball knocking down 0 pins' do
    @game.roll 0
  end

  it 'should score a gutter game' do
    roll_many 20, 0
    expect(@game.score).to eq(0)
  end

  it 'should score all ones' do
    roll_many 20, 1
    expect(@game.score).to eq(20)
  end

  it 'should score an spare' do
    roll_spare
    @game.roll 3
    roll_many 17, 0
    expect(@game.score).to eq(16)
  end

  def roll_many(times, pins_down)
    times.times do
      @game.roll pins_down
    end
  end

  def roll_spare
    @game.roll 5
    @game.roll 5
  end
end
```

And with this, we finish the refactoring. Next, we want to handle the *strike* case.

## *Strike!*

A *strike* implies knocking down all of the pins in a single throw. In this case, the *bonus* equals the sum of the points obtained in the two following rolls. The next test sets up an example:

```ruby
require 'rspec'
require_relative '../src/bowling_game'

RSpec.describe 'A Bowling Game' do

  before do
    @game = BowlingGame.new
  end

  it 'should roll a ball knocking down 0 pins' do
    @game.roll 0
  end

  it 'should score a gutter game' do
    roll_many 20, 0
    expect(@game.score).to eq(0)
  end

  it 'should score all ones' do
    roll_many 20, 1
    expect(@game.score).to eq(20)
  end

  it 'should score an spare' do
    roll_spare
    @game.roll 3
    roll_many 17, 0
    expect(@game.score).to eq(16)
  end

  it 'should score an strike' do
    @game.roll(10)
    @game.roll(4)
    @game.roll(3)
    roll_many 17, 0
    expect(@game.score).to eq(24)
  end

  def roll_many(times, pins_down)
    times.times do
      @game.roll pins_down
    end
  end

  def roll_spare
    @game.roll 5
    @game.roll 5
  end
end
```

This time the test fails because the production code calculates a total of 17 points (10 from the strike, plus 7 more from the two next throws). However, it should be counting that 7 twice: the bonus and the normal score.

Now, we have everything that we need in the production code, and in principle, we shouldn't have to go back. Just introduce the necessary changes. Fundamentally, we're interested in detecting that the *strike* has happened.

```ruby
class BowlingGame

  def initialize
    @rolls = []
  end

  def roll(pins_down)
    @rolls.push pins_down
  end

  FRAMES_IN_A_GAME = 10
  ALL_PINS_DOWN = 10

  def score
    score = 0
    roll = 0

    FRAMES_IN_A_GAME.times do
      if @rolls[roll] == 10
        frame_score = 10 + @rolls[roll + 1] + @rolls[roll + 2]
        roll += 1
      else
        frame_score = base_frame_score roll
        frame_score += @rolls[roll + 2] if spare? frame_score
        roll += 2
      end
      score += frame_score
    end

    score
  end

  private

  def spare?(frame_score)
    frame_score == ALL_PINS_DOWN
  end

  def base_frame_score(roll)
    @rolls[roll] + @rolls[roll + 1]
  end
end
```

## Reorganizing the game knowledge

Our current production code lets us pass the tests, so we're ready to fix its structure

Let's start by making some things about the *strike* more explicit:

```ruby
class BowlingGame

  def initialize
    @rolls = []
  end

  def roll(pins_down)
    @rolls.push pins_down
  end

  FRAMES_IN_A_GAME = 10
  ALL_PINS_DOWN = 10

  def score
    score = 0
    roll = 0

    FRAMES_IN_A_GAME.times do
      if strike? roll
        frame_score = 10 + base_frame_score(roll + 1)
        roll += 1
      else
        frame_score = base_frame_score roll
        frame_score += @rolls[roll + 2] if spare? frame_score
        roll += 2
      end
      score += frame_score
    end

    score
  end

  private

  def strike?(roll)
    @rolls[roll] == ALL_PINS_DOWN
  end

  def spare?(frame_score)
    frame_score == ALL_PINS_DOWN
  end

  def base_frame_score(roll)
    @rolls[roll] + @rolls[roll + 1]
  end
end
```

The structure of the *frame's* score calculation is not very clear, so we're going to go back and change it so it's more expressive:

```ruby
class BowlingGame

  def initialize
    @rolls = []
  end

  def roll(pins_down)
    @rolls.push pins_down
  end

  FRAMES_IN_A_GAME = 10
  ALL_PINS_DOWN = 10

  def score
    score = 0
    roll = 0

    FRAMES_IN_A_GAME.times do
      if strike? roll
        frame_score = 10 + base_frame_score(roll + 1)
        roll += 1
      elsif spare? base_frame_score roll
        frame_score = 10 + @rolls[roll + 2]
        roll += 2
      else
        frame_score = base_frame_score roll
        roll += 2
      end
      score += frame_score
    end

    score
  end

  private

  def strike?(roll)
    @rolls[roll] == ALL_PINS_DOWN
  end

  def spare?(frame_score)
    frame_score == ALL_PINS_DOWN
  end

  def base_frame_score(roll)
    @rolls[roll] + @rolls[roll + 1]
  end
end
```

This refactor makes it clear that `strike` and `spare` have a different structure, which makes them harder to understand and manage. We change `spare` to make them the same, and while we're at it, we also remove the magic numbers.

```ruby
class BowlingGame

  def initialize
    @rolls = []
  end

  def roll(pins_down)
    @rolls.push pins_down
  end

  FRAMES_IN_A_GAME = 10
  ALL_PINS_DOWN = 10

  def score
    score = 0
    roll = 0

    FRAMES_IN_A_GAME.times do
      if strike? roll
        frame_score = ALL_PINS_DOWN + base_frame_score(roll + 1)
        roll += 1
      elsif spare? roll
        frame_score = ALL_PINS_DOWN + @rolls[roll + 2]
        roll += 2
      else
        frame_score = base_frame_score roll
        roll += 2
      end
      score += frame_score
    end

    score
  end

  private

  def strike?(roll)
    ALL_PINS_DOWN == @rolls[roll]
  end

  def spare?(roll)
    ALL_PINS_DOWN == base_frame_score(roll)
  end

  def base_frame_score(roll)
    @rolls[roll] + @rolls[roll + 1]
  end
end
```

Now we can extract methods to make the calculations more explicit:

```ruby
class BowlingGame

  def initialize
    @rolls = []
  end

  def roll(pins_down)
    @rolls.push pins_down
  end

  FRAMES_IN_A_GAME = 10
  ALL_PINS_DOWN = 10

  def score
    score = 0
    roll = 0

    FRAMES_IN_A_GAME.times do
      if strike? roll
        frame_score = strike_score roll
        roll += 1
      elsif spare? roll
        frame_score = spare_score roll
        roll += 2
      else
        frame_score = base_frame_score roll
        roll += 2
      end
      score += frame_score
    end

    score
  end

  private

  def spare_score(roll)
    ALL_PINS_DOWN + @rolls[roll + 2]
  end

  def strike_score(roll)
    ALL_PINS_DOWN + base_frame_score(roll + 1)
  end

  def strike?(roll)
    ALL_PINS_DOWN == @rolls[roll]
  end

  def spare?(roll)
    ALL_PINS_DOWN == base_frame_score(roll)
  end

  def base_frame_score(roll)
    @rolls[roll] + @rolls[roll + 1]
  end
end
```

## The world's best player

In principle, our current development is sufficient. However, it's convenient to have test to certify it. For example, this new test corresponds to a perfect game: all of the rolls are strikes:

```ruby
require 'rspec'
require_relative '../src/bowling_game'

RSpec.describe 'A Bowling Game' do

  before do
    @game = BowlingGame.new
  end

  it 'should roll a ball knocking down 0 pins' do
    @game.roll 0
  end

  it 'should score a gutter game' do
    roll_many 20, 0
    expect(@game.score).to eq(0)
  end

  it 'should score all ones' do
    roll_many 20, 1
    expect(@game.score).to eq(20)
  end

  it 'should score an spare' do
    roll_spare
    @game.roll 3
    roll_many 17, 0
    expect(@game.score).to eq(16)
  end

  it 'should score an strike' do
    @game.roll(10)
    @game.roll(4)
    @game.roll(3)
    roll_many 17, 0
    expect(@game.score).to eq(24)
  end

  def roll_many(times, pins_down)
    times.times do
      @game.roll pins_down
    end
  end

  it 'should score perfect game' do
    roll_many 12, 10
    expect(@game.score).to eq(300)
  end

  def roll_spare
    @game.roll 5
    @game.roll 5
  end
end
```

When we run it, the test passes, which confirms us that BowlingGame is working as expected.

With all of the tests passing and the functionality completely implemented, we could try to evolve the code towards a better design. In the following example, we've extracted a `Rolls` class which is basically an array that also has all of the score calculation methods that we've been extracting so far:

```ruby
class Rolls<Array
  ALL_PINS_DOWN = 10

  def spare_score(roll)
    ALL_PINS_DOWN + self[roll + 2]
  end

  def strike_score(roll)
    ALL_PINS_DOWN + base_frame_score(roll + 1)
  end

  def strike?(roll)
    ALL_PINS_DOWN == self[roll]
  end

  def spare?(roll)
    ALL_PINS_DOWN == base_frame_score(roll)
  end

  def base_frame_score(roll)
    self[roll] + self[roll + 1]
  end
end


class BowlingGame

  def initialize
    @rolls = Rolls.new
  end

  def roll(pins_down)
    @rolls.push pins_down
  end

  FRAMES_IN_A_GAME = 10

  def score
    score = 0
    roll = 0

    FRAMES_IN_A_GAME.times do
      if @rolls.strike? roll
        frame_score = @rolls.strike_score roll
        roll += 1
      elsif @rolls.spare? roll
        frame_score = @rolls.spare_score roll
        roll += 2
      else
        frame_score = @rolls.base_frame_score roll
        roll += 2
      end
      score += frame_score
    end

    score
  end
end
```


## What have we learned with this kata

* Refactoring is the the design stage in classic TDD, it's the moment at which, once we've implemented a behavior, we reorganize the code so that it's clearer and better expressed.
* We must take the refactoring opportunities right when we detect them.
* We refactor both the test and the production code.
