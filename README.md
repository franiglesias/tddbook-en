## The way to TDD

**This is a work in progress**

Book project to help learning TDD, with several proposals of sequenced katas to address several details of the methodology. Katas are organized in formulation, resolution examples and a complete explanation of the main point illustrated with the exercise.

You could use the book as support material for a TDD course. Each kata was selected and oriented to exemplify an specific point in the test driven development process.

Each kata is developed in a different programming language.
